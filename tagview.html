                    This is your video's headline. If it showed up in a search, would you click on it?
                    Always represent your content accurately.
                    Offer keywords first, branding at the end.
                    For serial content, add the episode number to the end of the title.
                    Update video titles so they continue to grab views..

                    Only the first few sentences of your description will appear in search results or above the fold on a watch page - so make them count!
                    Follow a template for all of your video descriptions to create consistency.
                    Accurately describe your video in one or two concise sentences.

                <p class="step-guidance">
                    Tags are descriptive keywords that will help people find your videos.
                    Create a set of standard tags for your channel that can be applied to any video you publish (e.g. filmmaking, animation, comedy, "Funny Videos," "Pet Videos," etc).
                    Include a mix of both general and specific tags.
                    Use enough tags to thoroughly and accurately describe the video.
                    Update catalogue videos' tags when new search trends emerge.
                    Properly format tags to ensure proper indexing of your video.
                    Include keywords from your title in your video's tags.
                    List them in order of relevance to the video and try to use the whole 500-character limit.

                <p class="step-guidance">
                    Thumbnails show up in different sizes and formats all across the YouTube platform and outside of it.
                    Make sure you've got a strong, vibrant image that pops no matter what size it is.
                    Use visual cues (colors, images, shapes, personalities) that are consistent with your brand.
                    Clear, in-focus, high-resolution (1280px by 720px min).
                    Visually compelling imagery that is well-framed with good composition.
                    Foreground stands out from background
                    Consider the legibility of your thumbnail at multiple sizes. Thumbnails change size depending on the YouTube placement and device.
                    Bright, high-contrast and close-ups of faces tend to work better.

                    The key is to use cards to deliver additional value to your viewer.

                    When appropriate, set cards to open a new window when clicked. Be careful! Don't take viewers away from a video too soon.

                    Playlists make it easy for viewers to sit back and watch multiple videos of yours with minimal effort which increases views and watch time for your channel.

                    Add to more than one playlist if it makes sense to.
                    Add this video a to a Playlist marked as an Official Series Playlist in order to keep viewer from watch other channels after the video is over.
                    Create a new Playlist if this video doesn't fit into your existing Playlists
