                    Create a set of standard tags for your channel that can be applied to any video you publish (e.g. filmmaking, animation, comedy, "Funny Videos," "Pet Videos," etc).
                    Include a mix of both general and specific tags.
                    Use enough tags to thoroughly and accurately describe the video.

                    Properly format tags to ensure proper indexing of your video.

                    Thumbnails show up in different sizes and formats all across the YouTube platform and outside of it.
                    Make sure you've got a strong, vibrant image that pops no matter what size it is.
                    Use visual cues (colors, images, shapes, personalities) that are consistent with your brand.
                    Clear, in-focus, high-resolution (1280px by 720px min).
                    Visually compelling imagery that is well-framed with good composition.

                    Consider the legibility of your thumbnail at multiple sizes. Thumbnails change size depending on the YouTube placement and device.
                    Bright, high-contrast and close-ups of faces tend to work better.

                    Cards are a way to complement your video's content and enhance the viewer experience with contextually relevant information.
                    They are a great way to encourage your viewers to engage with your video and take meaningful actions as a result.
                    The key is to use cards to deliver additional value to your viewer.

                    When appropriate, set cards to open a new window when clicked. Be careful! Don't take viewers away from a video too soon.
